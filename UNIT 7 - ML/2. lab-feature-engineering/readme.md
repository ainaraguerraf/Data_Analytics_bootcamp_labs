# Lab | Feature engineering

# Results of the lab can be found [here](https://github.com/ainaraguerraf/Ironhack_labs/blob/main/UNIT%207%20-%20ML/2.%20lab-feature-engineering-master/Lab%20Feature%20Engineering%20-%20Ainara.ipynb)
- In this lab, you will use `learningSet.csv` file which you have already cloned in the previous activities. 

### Instructions

Here we will work on cleaning some of the other columns in the dataset using the techniques that we used before in the lessons.

- Check for null values in the numerical columns.
- Use appropriate methods to clean the columns `GEOCODE2`, `WEALTH1`, `ADI`, `DMA`,and `MSA`.
- Use appropriate EDA technique where ever necessary.
